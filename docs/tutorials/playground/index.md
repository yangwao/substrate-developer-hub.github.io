title: Introduction
---

As [the first tutorial](../create-your-first-substrate-chain) demonstrated, the
[Substrate Developer Hub Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
is a working blockchain node that is designed to be a flexible starting point for a new
Substrate-based blockchain. The Node Template is comprised of
[a number of components](../../index#architecture), including a
[runtime](../../knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#runtime) that is constructed using the
[FRAME](../../knowledgebase/runtime/frame) system for runtime development. FRAME takes a
compositional approach to runtime development, which means that a custom runtime is created by
[composing modules](../../knowledgebase/runtime/macros#construct_runtime), known in FRAME as
"pallets". The Substrate codebase ships with
[dozens of battle-tested pallets](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/v2.0.0-rc6/frame) and
the goal of this tutorial is to explain and demonstrate the steps that are taken when adding a
simple pre-built pallet to a FRAME runtime. Subsequent tutorials will explain how to
[write a new FRAME pallet](../build-a-dapp) in order to encapsulate custom logic.

If you have problems with this tutorial, the Substrate community is full of helpful resources. We
maintain an active
[#SubstrateTechnical chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/!HzySYSaIhtyWrwiwEV:matrix.org) and
monitor the
[`substrate` tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate). You can
also use the [`subport` GitHub repository](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues/new) to
create an Issue.

## Substrate Playground

This tutorial will use the [Substrate Playground](https://playground.substrate.dev/), an online IDE
that makes it easier to build with Substrate by abstracting system dependencies and providing a
pre-built Node Template. The Playground uses GitHub authentication, so users are required to have
[a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Login to the Playground, make sure that "Node template"
is selected, and click "CREATE".
